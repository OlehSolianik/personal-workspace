# Personal Workspace

A lightweight personal productivity workspace built with **vanilla JavaScript**.

This project combines ideas from note-taking, task management, and knowledge base tools
into a single, minimal, offline-first web application, without frameworks or build tools. 

## ✨ Features

- Unified workspace for notes and tasks
- Hierarchical structure (pages / items)
- Keyboard-first and fully accessible UI components
- Local persistence (offline-first)
- Accessible, semantic HTML
- Clean, modular architecture

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main goals of this project are:

- explore how far modern web standards can go without frameworks
- practice application architecture and state management
- build a realistic, maintainable frontend project
- maintain a clean and meaningful Git history

This is a long-term project developed incrementally with a focus on clarity and quality.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack 

- **HTML5** — semantic & accessible markup 
- **CSS3** — UI/UX design 
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** — application logic 
- **Web APIs** — DOM, localStorage

No frameworks. No bundlers. No external dependencies. 

## ✏️ Development Approach 

- small, single-feature focused commits
- feature branches merged into main
- incremental feature delivery
- refactoring as a continuous process

Commit history is treated as part of the project documentation.
